## Welcome to Shaun Cmar's ePortfolio

### A brief background
As a part of my time at Southern New Hampshire University, and my professional career I have learned about the how to
best design software.  My time in the industry began in 2006 when I attended the University of New Hampshire, and worked
at a network testing lab.  After leaving the University of New Hampshire I spent some time working as a sales associate
at best buy to keep myself in the industry, and to expand my soft skills.  During my time at Best Buy I began to take
classes at NHTI in information technology, with a concentration in networking.  At the same time I began to work at
a software development company, Newforma, in Manchester, NH as a support technician for the cloud product that they produced.

While completing my Associates in Information Technology, I advanced my capabilities at Newforma, and began performing
Database Administration style work for them and worked very closely with a software engineer.  He recommended I shift out 
of Technical Support and move into a Development Support position.  In this position, I wrote tools that developers would 
use to make their day to day life easier.  These tools included a deployment pipeline which ran the developers code 
through unit tests, deployment into a cloud environment, and acceptance test the now deployed code. During my time in this 
role I learned a lot about the development process, from initial design, to coding, to code review.  

Today I work for Newforma as a Full Stack developer as well as finishing my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from
Southern New Hampshire University though their online program.

### Professional Assessment

### Code Review
The Code review process is a useful tool which Software Developers use to learn new skills, or best practices as well as 
review the process.  I did an informal code review, using a [checklist](./CodeReview/SNHU_Code_Review_Checklist.pdf) 
provided in my Capstone Class, CS-499 at SNHU.  The artifact I reviewed can be found 
[within the project](./Original%20Artifact/finalProjectPythonFiles.zip)  During this code review I outline the changes 
I intend to make to the artifact, and how they relate to my time within the computer science program.  I recorded the 
code review and it may be found [on youtube.](https://youtu.be/GsANZLlW95w)

### Software Design/Engineering
The artifact is a RESTful CRUD API that was written initially in Python, and may be found 
[within the proejct](./Original%20Artifact/finalProjectPythonFiles.zip) but as apart of this course was converted the 
artifact to JavaScript.  It was initially created as apart of CS-340 a few semesters ago.  The new artifact can be found
[within the project.](./Software%20Design%20and%20Engineering/mongoDbAccessor.zip)

I choose this item because it represented a basic API which I worked on, and saw a lot of room for improvement.  I 
selected JavaScript because in my day to day job I work in TypeScript, which is just different enough from JavaScript to 
pose a real challenge, and I want to learn the under workings of TypeScript.  I was able to convert the artifact to 
JavaScript, and gained some exposure to a slightly different interface to MongoDb.  I also added comments before each 
method that was added so that it is more apparent as to what each method does. 

I learned that there are a large number of mongodb clients out there, and that setting up a REST CRUD API in JavaScript 
was as straightforward as in python.  I did have a few problems because my version of node was only version 6 on my 
laptop and I did not check my version until I after I started debugging.  I also found that working in JavaScript objects 
were handled a bit different than I expected.  

### Algorithms and Data structures
The artifact is a RESTful CRUD API that was written initially in Python, and may be found 
[within the proejct](./Original%20Artifact/finalProjectPythonFiles.zip) but as apart of this course was 
converted to the artifact into JavaScript.  It was initially created as apart of CS-340 a few semesters ago. 
This new artifact can be found [within the project.](./Algoritms%20and%20Data%20Structures/mongoDbAccessor.zip);

I choose this item because it represented a basic API which I worked on, and saw a lot of room for improvement.  I 
selected JavaScript because in my day to day job I work in TypeScript, which is just different enough from JavaScript 
to pose a real challenge, and I want to learn the under workings of TypeScript.  I was able to convert the artifact to 
JavaScript, and gained some exposure to a slightly different interface to MongoDb.  I also added comments before each 
method that was added so that it is more apparent as to what each method does. 

I learned that it is incredibly important to consider what the real requirements are of your system.  
Initially I was going to use JOI validation to make sure each JavaScript field was present. However, that was not 
necessary because these fields are all non-required fields, the only real required field is passed in in the URL 
parameters.  I also am learning how incredibly useful typing is, as at times it can be ambiguous about what is being 
passed around.

### Databases 
The artifact that I am including is a front end HTML/JavaScript for a mongoDb.  I created it this week for the final project.
This will be an interface for the mongoDb which was created as a part of CS340. This artifact can be found 
[within the project.](./Databases/frontend.zip)

I choose to include this artifact in my portfolio because it continues to show that I have the ability to adapt a previously 
created project, and add a front end onto it in order to best display the information to an end users.  

I have not interfaced with HTML/JavaScript in this manner before.  I found there to be a quite a bit of research in 
order to appropriately map variables (inputs/output) text boxes.  Furthermore, I got some insight on how much customization
HTML really has.  Having not used it before, I didn't realize how important design will be to a project.   The artifact 
that I produced is a white web page with a few text boxes on it.  There is a lot left to be desired as far as a web page 
that customers would pay to use.
