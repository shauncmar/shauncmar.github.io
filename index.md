## Welcome to Shaun Cmar's ePortfolio

### A brief background
As a part of my time at Southern New Hampshire University, and my professional career I have learned about the how to
best design software.  My time in the industry began in 2006 when I attended the University of New Hampshire, and worked
at a network testing lab.  After leaving the University of New Hampshire I spent some time working as a sales associate
at best buy to keep myself in the industry, and to expand my soft skills.  During my time at Best Buy I began to take
classes at NHTI in information technology, with a concentration in networking.  At the same time I began to work at
a software development company, Newforma, in Manchester, NH as a support technician for the cloud product that they produced.

While completing my Associates in Information Technology, I advanced my capabilities at Newforma, and began performing
Database Administration style work for them and worked very closely with a software engineer.  He recommended I shift out 
of Technical Support and move into a Development Support position.  In this position, I wrote tools that developers would 
use to make their day to day life easier.  These tools included a deployment pipeline which ran the developers code 
through unit tests, deployment into a cloud environment, and acceptance test the now deployed code. During my time in this 
role I learned a lot about the development process, from initial design, to coding, to code review.  

Today I work for Newforma as a Full Stack developer as well as finishing my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from
Souther New Hampshire University though their online program.

### Code Review
The Code review process is a useful tool which Software Developers use to learn new skills, or best practices as well as 
review the process.  I did an informal code review, using a [checklist](https://youtu.be/GsANZLlW95w) 
provided in my Capstone Class, CS-499 at SNHU.  During this code review I outline the changes I intend to make to the
artifacts, and how they relate to my time within the course.

### Software Design/Engineering
The artifact is a RESTful CRUD API that was written initially in Python but as apart of this course was converted to the 
artifact into JavaScript.  It was initially created as apart of CS-340 a few semesters ago.  

I choose this item because it represented a basic API which I worked on, and saw a lot of room for improvement.  I 
selected JavaScript because in my day to day job I work in TypeScript, which is just different enough from JavaScript to 
pose a real challenge, and I want to learn the under workings of TypeScript.  I was able to convert the artifact to 
JavaScript, and gained some exposure to a slightly different interface to MongoDb.  I also added comments before each 
method that was added so that it is more apparent as to what each method does. 

The enhancement plan for this milestone was to convert the CRUD API from python to JavaScript.  I was able to complete 
this goal and added comments, and updated the variable names to that are more descriptive.  

I learned that there are a large number of mongodb clients out there, and that setting up a REST CRUD API in JavaScript 
was as straightforward as in python.  I did have a few problems because my version of node was only version 6 on my 
laptop and I did not check my version until I after I started debugging.  I also found that working in JavaScript objects 
were handled a bit different than I expected.  

### Algorithms and Data structures
The artifact is a RESTful CRUD API that was written initially in Python but as apart of this course was converted to the 
artifact into JavaScript.  It was initially created as apart of CS-340 a few semesters ago. 

I choose this item because it represented a basic API which I worked on, and saw a lot of room for improvement.  I 
selected JavaScript because in my day to day job I work in TypeScript, which is just different enough from JavaScript 
to pose a real challenge, and I want to learn the under workings of TypeScript.  I was able to convert the artifact to 
JavaScript, and gained some exposure to a slightly different interface to MongoDb.  I also added comments before each 
method that was added so that it is more apparent as to what each method does. 

The enhancement plan for this milestone was to add in code comments to make the code more readable, ensure that the
variables, and function names are readable, as well as add validation of the objects being passed in.  
It was also to ensure that the end user had less control over the operations performed. We did this by using a JSON 
parse and making sure that no MongoDB specifics were required to perform the operations. 

In this milestone I learned that it is incredibly important to consider what the real requirements are of your system.  
Initially I was going to use JOI validation to make sure each JavaScript field was present. However, that was not 
necessary because these fields are all non-required fields, the only real required field is passed in in the URL 
parameters.  I also am learning how incredibly useful typing is, as at times it can be ambiguous about what is being 
passed around.

### Databases 
The artifact that I am including is a front end HTML/JavaScript for a mongoDb.  I created it this week for the final project.
This will be an interface for the mongoDb which was created as a part of CS340.  
I choose to include this artifact in my portfolio because it continues to show that I have the ability to adapt a previously 
created project, and add a front end onto it in order to best display the information to an end users.  
I have completed a fair amount of this work but still have make the calls to the mongoDb and then map the values back 
to functions.  There were no changes to the outcome plans 
I have not interfaced with HTML/JavaScript in this manner before.  I found there to be a quite a bit of research in 
order to appropriately map variables (inputs/output) text boxes.
