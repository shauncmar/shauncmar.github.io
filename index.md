## Welcome to Shaun Cmar's ePortfolio

### A brief background
As a part of my time at Southern New Hampshire University, and my professional career I have learned about the how to
best design software.  My time in the industry began in 2006 when I attended the University of New Hampshire, and worked
at a network testing lab.  After leaving the University of New Hampshire I spent some time working as a sales associate
at best buy to keep myself in the industry, and to expand my soft skills.  During my time at Best Buy I began to take
classes at NHTI in information technology, with a concentration in networking.  At the same time I began to work at
a software development company, Newforma, in Manchester, NH as a support technician for the cloud product that they produced.

While completing my Associates in Information Technology, I advanced my capabilities at Newforma, and began performing
Database Administration style work for them and worked very closely with a software engineer.  He recommended I shift out 
of Technical Support and move into a Development Support position.  In this position, I wrote tools that developers would 
use to make their day to day life easier.  These tools included a deployment pipeline which ran the developers code 
through unit tests, deployment into a cloud environment, and acceptance test the now deployed code. During my time in this 
role I learned a lot about the development process, from initial design, to coding, to code review.  

Today I work for Newforma as a Full Stack developer as well as finishing my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from
Souther New Hampshire University though their online program.

### Code Review
The Code review process is a useful tool which Software Developers use to learn new skills, or best practices as well as 
review the process.  I did an informal code review, using a [checklist](./CodeReview/SNHU_Code_Review_Checklist.pdf) 
provided in my Capstone Class, CS-499 at SNHU.  During this code review I outline the changes I intend to make to the
artifacts, and how they relate to my time within the courses. Please review the recording of my process to see how I
perform a [code review](/CodeReview/Cmar_Code_Review.mp4).
